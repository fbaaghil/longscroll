						<h1>About ORLW</h1>
					</header>
					<p>This project is for the ORLW or One Really Long Webpage assignment, 
						an extra-long webpage made using html, css, and javascript. The page must teach something, wither an info-graphic or a
						narrative. It can scroll vertically 
						or horizontally and must use a combination of fixes and relative positioned elements, and at least some elements must overlap. 
						I decided to pay homage to L.M. Montgomery's
						book, Anne of Green Gables.
						My three major design decisions were color, layout, and positioning. I wanted colors that would
						remind one of a book, without being simply black and white. So, I decided on a sketched look for the images, black and white,
						yet the background a gray and white color. I wanted a dormant pop of color and decided on a green. My second major design decision was the layout. I wanted a smooth scrolling, yet in a storytelling way. So, I decided on having the text and an image in a column format. My third major design decision was the positioning in deciding where to place my link for my about page. I didn’t want it to be extremely noticeable, so I placed it fixed to the bottom of the page, 
						while scrolling would be seen, yet with small font-size, so it wouldn’t distract the viewer from the long scroll. 
						The most challenging part of this assignment was figuring out how to correctly code the javascript without it breaking.  I had to make sure to place the javascript code in different areas to make it run smoothly. The most exciting part now that the project is done was having fixed and absolute elements in my website that make it seem as if my website was animated. I learned a lot of things in this assignment, mainly knowing how to select certain classes to make it animate or appear when and where I want it. My biggest takeaway is learning how to do javascript.
						It was extremely difficult for me to learn javascript, but I’m glad I understand the concept of it.

						<h1>Anne of Green Gables</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Anne of Green Gables is a 1908 novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery. Written for all ages, it has been considered a children's novel
						since the mid-twentieth century. It recounts the adventures of Anne Shirley, an 11-year-old orphan girl who is mistakenly sent to Matthew and
						Marilla Cuthbert, a middle-aged brother and sister who had intended to adopt a boy to help them on their farm in Prince Edward Island. The novel
						 recounts how Anne makes her way with the Cuthberts, in school, and within the town.
Since its publication, Anne of Green Gables has sold more than 50 million copies and has been translated into 20 languages.
Montgomery wrote numerous sequels, and since her death, another sequel has been published, as well as an authorized prequel. The original book is taught to
students around the world.[4]
The book has been adapted as films, made-for-television movies, and animated and live-action television series. Musicals and plays have also been created,
with productions annually in Canada since 1964 of the first musical production, which has toured in Canada, the United States, Europe, and Japan.</p>
