						<h1>Anne Shirley</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Anne Shirley is a young orphan, bounced from one foster home to the next. With an overactive imagination, greenish-gray eyes, and bright-red hair,
						 Anne had to build a wall of strength and hope inside her to combat the cruelty of her foster families. All she ever wanted was a family to love
						 and a place to call home.

						<h1>Green Gables</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Anne is given the chance when she is sent to live at Green Gables, with brother and sister, Matthew and Marilla. The island is beautiful, with glistening
						 lakes and over-full blossom trees. Anne is overcome with happiness on seeing Matthew for the first time, his kind heart matching his tender nature.
						 Her happiness is furthered by seeing the picturesque Green Gables. </p>

						<h1>The Trial</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Yet, Anne’s hopes are dashed when Marilla informs her that they expected a boy. “If I were beautiful, with nut-brown hair, would you keep me?”
						Anne is about to be given to a woman intending to adopt a worker, when
						Marilla has a sudden change of heart. Anne is told she mustn’t keep her hopes up as she will first be given a trial until a final decision is made. </p>

					<p>Anne’s trial doesn’t start well as her first test comes in the case of Marilla’s friend, Mrs. Rachel Lynde, a
						gossipy, over-opinionated woman. On Anne’s first meeting with her, Rachel Lynde
						criticizes her looks, and…Anne’s red hair. Anne is furious and answers angrily, “How would you like to be told your fat, ugly, and a sour-old gossip?” </p>

					<p>Marilla warns Anne to apologize or else her trial at Green Gables will be terminated. However, Anne’s pride and

						<h1>Dilemma</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Another dilemma arises for Anne when Marilla finds her amethyst brooch missing. Angry and upset, she doesn’t believe Anne didn’t take the brooch.
						When Anne makes up a confession, Marilla believing it to be true, is set to take her back.
						 However, Marilla is the one embarrassed when she finds the brooch on her shawl. Marilla apologizes and once again, Anne’s trial is sustained.  </p>

						<h1>Bosom Friend</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Anne is taken to a picnic, where she meets and makes her first real friend, Diana Barry, or as Anne calls her,
						“my bosom friend.” Sent to school, Anne is desirous at acing all her classes. Yet, on her first day, Anne gets into trouble when a boy,
						Gilbert Blythe tries to get her attention. Choosing to ignore him, he further seeks to get her attention by calling her, “Carrots.” Anne’s s
						ensitivity over her hair causes her to slam her slate down on his head. She is punished and dreads what Marilla’s decision on her trial at Green Gables will be. She is surprised and delighted when Marilla says, “Your trial at Green Gables is over. I’ve decided you can stay.” </p>
